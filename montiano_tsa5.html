            <p class="desc">As one of the Four Emperors, and at the young age of 19, Luffy is one of the four most
                powerful pirates in the world. He captains the Straw Hat Pirates, holding the greatest authority over a
                mighty and diverse crew consisting of several infamous members, many of whom are extremely powerful in
                their own right,
                Luffy has a tremendous amount of influence over his crewmates, so much so that they all trust him with
                their lives, despite his reckless behavior and, in some cases, even because of it. He is also one of
                twelve pirates who have been dubbed the "Worst Generation", a group of individuals who have become
                infamous for the bold and major actions they have committed against the World Government, and all have
                bounties of over Beli100,000,000. Indirectly, he also has claim over the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, a
                massive fleet consisting of seven powerful New World crews numbering 5640 people in total, who all swore
                to serve under him of their own will and come to assist him whenever he may need them.</p>
